# BiFET

Bias-free Footprint Enrichment Test (BiFET) is a statistical method 
that aims to identify transcription factors (TFs) whose
footprints are over-represented in target regions compared to background 
regions after correcting for differences in read counts and GC contents between
target and background regions, where regions represent ATAC-seq or DNAse-seq peaks.
