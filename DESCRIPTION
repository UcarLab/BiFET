Description: BiFET identifies TFs whose footprints are over-represented in
    target regions compared to background regions after correcting for the
    bias arising from the imbalance in read counts and GC contents between
    the target and background regions. For a given TF k, BiFET tests the null
    hypothesis that the target regions have the same probability of having
    footprints for the TF k as the background regions while correcting for
    the read count and GC content bias. For this, we use the number of target
    regions with footprints for TF k, t_k as a test statistic and calculate
    the p-value as the probability of observing t_k or more target regions
    with footprints under the null hypothesis.
